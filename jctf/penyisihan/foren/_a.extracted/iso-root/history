Perched upon a hill so high,
Above a village peaceful and still,
Unleashed a force that made all cry,
Laying waste to homes and fields at will.

Screeches of pain, a deafening sound,
Tortured souls and broken dreams,
Ravaging through with no remorse found,
Eclipsing all that was serene.

The red sky was his sign of dread,
Conjuring death from his fiery shell,
Heralding destruction with every breath,
Every breath a fight, a battle to catch.

Death and destruction, a grave mismatch.
